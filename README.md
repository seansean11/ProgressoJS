# ProgressoJS

###A lightweight, accurate jQuery plugin for preloading assets and displaying progress

ProgressoJS is one of the only accurate and declaraitive asset preloaders, which provides you with the tools you need to create your own loading screen animations. There are other asset preloaders or load animators, but most of them will require you to declare your preloaded assets in the head of your HTML document or may only simulate progress. ProgressoJS lets you declare your preloaded assets in their natural position in the HTML document, which means that it works with dynamic content and CMS's like WordPress, Drupal, ExpressionEngine, and Craft. ProgressoJS also taps into the actual sizes of your assets in order to provide you with an accurate progress measure that you can use for CSS or JavaScript animations.
